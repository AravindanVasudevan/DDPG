# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
This repo contains an in-progress implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for training a reinforcement learning agent to control the Mujoco Ant environment.

## Motivation
Reinforcement learning algorithms like DDPG have shown promise in solving complex control tasks. This project aims to apply DDPG to the Mujoco Ant environment to achieve efficient locomotion, which has practical applications in robotics and automation.
